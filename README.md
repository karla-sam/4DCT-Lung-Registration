# 4DCT-Lung-Registration
This repository contains the code used for the registration challenge between the inhale and exhale intrapatient CT scans from the 4DCT DIR-Lab Challenge Dataset. We normalized the images, segmented the lung area with thresholding and morphological operations, and finally performed a rigid and nonrigid registration with Simple-Elastix. The registration was evaluated by computing the mean and std distance of the landmarks provided by the challenge.
